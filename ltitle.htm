  <li>This is Yie-Sheng Chen. I am from Taiwan. During my first semester here, I encountered a sentence from John von Neumann at my compiler textbook that I wish I knew earlier: "in mathematics you don't understand things. You just get used to them"</li>
  <li>I am a Ph.D student in the Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering at The University of New Mexico, USA, as a member of the Performance and Resource Optimization in Networks (PROTON) Lab, with Prof. E. E. Tsiropoulou as an advisor since July 2023.</li>
