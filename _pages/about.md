- I am a Ph.D. student in the <a href="http://www.ece.unm.edu" target="_blank">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> at <a href="http://www.unm.edu" target="_blank">The University of New Mexico, USA</a> and a member of the PROTON lab, with <a href="http://ece-research.unm.edu/tsiropoulou/index.html" target="_blank">Prof. E.E.Tsiropoulou</a> as an advisor. Before joining UNM, I received my Masterâ€™s Degree from the Department of Computer & Information Science & Engineering, <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/" target="_blank">University of Florida</a>, USA, in May 2013. While obtaining my degree, I worked as a grader for under grad programming course offered by <a href="https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~jcliu/" target="_blank">Dr Jonathan C.L. Kavalan</a> at the University of Florida. 
- My major research field of interest is, and not limited to Wireless Networks, Online Social Networks (OSNs), Positioning, Navigation and Timing (PNT), and Smart Grid Systems. I am currently conducting research to find effective solutions for resource optimization in interdependent systems such as 5G/6G Wireless Heterogenous Networks through employing game theory, optimization techniques, and advanced learning techniques.
